I"ÿ<p>This marks the second iteration of mrghorm.com, now using the Jekyll SSG.  This post is pretty much just an example post thatâ€™s supposed to have a lot of text so I can see what Iâ€™m doing when Iâ€™m formatting the CSS.  This is a very long paragraph to test the excerpt and see how far it will go, as well as if it will wrap around the picture and whatnot.  Honestly, I just need to write a bunch of BS and elongate this excerpt until itâ€™s unreasonably long and stuff.  Iâ€™m not sure what else to type.  Is this long enough yet?  Lets :wq, build, and check.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not familiar with markdown yet, anyone know how to make a list?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is</li>
  <li>It</li>
  <li>Like</li>
  <li>This?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe.  We will see.</p>
