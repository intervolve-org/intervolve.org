I";<p>This marks the second iteration of mrghorm.com, now using the Jekyll SSG.  This post is pretty much just an example post that’s supposed to have a lot of text so I can see what I’m doing when I’m formatting the CSS.  This is a very long paragraph to test the excerpt and see how far it will go, as well as if it will wrap around the picture and whatnot.  Honestly, I just need to write a bunch of BS and elongate this excerpt until it’s unreasonably long and stuff.  I’m not sure what else to type.  Is this long enough yet?  Lets :wq, build, and check.</p>
