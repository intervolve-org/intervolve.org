### Hello from Greekenox!
I host a modded Minecraft pack at [mc.pootis.website](http://mc.pootis.website)
My website is a work in progress, if it will be anything more than that I dont know. Currently it is on a temporary server (for a few months). The server will be up at that domain as long as people want to play. This server is backed up off site daily.

**Valhelsia 3** has over 200 mods with natural themes like Botania and Blood Magic. Also more technical mods like ComputerCraft and Mekanizm. Or if you just want to explore there are many biome changes and mobs.

### To play this pack
- [Download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/valhelsia-3) v3.2.4
- Make sure you allocate more ram if your system has more than 8GB. By default it will use less than 4GB (I reccomend 6GB)
- Connect to ***mc.pootis.website***

This concludes Greekenox's first test page in markdown
