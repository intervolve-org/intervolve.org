### Hello from Greekenox!
I host a modded Minecraft pack at [mc.pootis.website](http://mc.pootis.website)
My website is a work in progress, if it will be anything more than that I dont know. Currently it is on a temporary server (for a few months). The server will be up at that domain as long as people want to play. This server is backed up off site daily.

**Valhelsia 3** has over 200 mods with natural themes like Botania and Blood Magic. Also more technical mods like ComputerCraft and Mekanizm.


### To play this pack
- [Download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/valhelsia-3) v3.2.4
- Make sure you allocate more ram if your system has more than 8GB. By default it will use less than 4GB (I reccomend 6GB)
- Connect to ***mc.pootis.website***

This concludes Greekenox's first test page in markdown
