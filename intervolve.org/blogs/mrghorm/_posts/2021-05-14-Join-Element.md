# What are those words?

* Element or Element.io:  Element is the chat _client_, which is the part that you see an interact with.  There are many other Matrix clients which connect to each other using the Matrix protocol (see below).
* Matrix:  Matrix is the chat _protocol_, which is the back-end language that any Matrix chat clients use to talk to each other through the Matrix homeservers.  Matrix can allow Element clients to talk to other Element or non-Element clients.
* Homeserver:  A homeserver is a server on which the Matrix protocol runs and stores data.  It acts as a "hub" so to speak.  When you connect your Element client to and create an account on a homeserver, all your data (encrypted or not) passes through the server from one Element client to another.  The homeserver can also connect to other homeservers to allow Element clients connected across different homeservers to operate.

# What's special about Element & Matrix?

Element is a chat client which you can use on just about any platform you can think of - including the web.  It uses the Matrix protocol to allow people to chat in end-to-end encrypted chat rooms, or non-encrypted chat rooms if they choose.  

What's special about Element is the ability to sign up for accounts on any Matrix homeservers you choose.  Unlike Discord, which has an array of central servers, anyone can run their own Matrix homeserver and keep their own data.  These homeservers can also be connected together to form a mesh of homeservers which can communicate to eachother if they want.

Most importantly - When you sign up to a homeserver, all of your messages, joined rooms, and profile information, are kept ___only___ on that homeserver, and no others (unless you join multiple).

We believe in decentralizing data to
