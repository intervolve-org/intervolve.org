# First post on Intervolve

Hello all, guess this is my first post on Intervolve, not sure what all to put in this one, but thought I would get a first post out. Hope this will be a good way for me to learn the whole Jekyll thing for building my own site at some point (if I actually get time this summer lol), as well as posting things on here. I guess that's all, I'm just adding crap at this point to try and make this post have some length to it lol.

Here, let's test a couple of markdown things:

You can actually do math stuff which is pretty neat, here's Shannon's equation of Entropy for Information Theory 
$$
H(x)=\sum p(x)log(1/p(x))
$$
Here's a pic from Firewatch that I like:

That is all.
